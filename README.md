"One positive effect of the non-conventional nature of me is the spark I have had ever since I was a young boy. It is like an uncontrollable wildfire where I absolutely have to sit down and sketch something whenever I have this unbelievable amount of energy â€” a burst of neurotransmitters â€” that flows through the neural pathways in my brain, fueling my overwhelming passion for **astrophysics**, **philosophy**, **computer science**, and **cinematography**."

# Featured Project :alien:


### [First Principles: An Interactive Module](https://github.com/GameGenesis/First-Principles)

A puzzle game that visualizes the nature of a curve and its corresponding derivative function, and how various rules (e.g. power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, squeeze theorem, and L'HÃ´pital's rule) of differentiation can work in a given equation. It further clarifies the relationship between the rules; for example, proving the mechanism behind power rule using the first principles lim h->0 (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h, or explaining the product rule using the power rule. Same goes for the editions that will be released later, which include topics such as definite/indefinite integration and infinite series.
