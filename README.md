My name is John. I am a **digital creator**, a self-employed **software engineer**, a **cinematographer**, and most importantly, a full-time **high school student**.

"One positive effect of the non-conventional nature of me is the spark I have had ever since I was a young boy. It is like an uncontrollable wildfire where I absolutely have to sit down and sketch something whenever I have this unbelievable amount of energy — a burst of neurotransmitters — that flows through the neural pathways in my brain, fueling my overwhelming passion for **astrophysics**, **philosophy**, **computer science**, and **cinematography**."

*– John Seong, Sept. 1, 2021.*

## ElectronVisualized

A **real-time** electron density simulation **single-handedly** developed by a **high school student**. Displayed based upon the internal calculations performed that involve the state-of-the-art **Projector Augmented-wave** (PAW) method and **Density Functional Theory** (DFT): describing the **probable locations of electrons** by simplifying the N-body Schrödinger's Equation into a relatively easier-to-compute N single-body problem.
