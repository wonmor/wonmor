My name is John. I am a **digital creator**, a self-employed **software engineer**, a **cinematographer**, and most importantly, a full-time **high school student**.

"One positive effect of the non-conventional nature of me is the spark I have had ever since I was a young boy. It is like an uncontrollable wildfire where I absolutely have to sit down and sketch something whenever I have this unbelievable amount of energy — a burst of neurotransmitters — that flows through the neural pathways in my brain, fueling my overwhelming passion for **astrophysics**, **philosophy**, **computer science**, and **cinematography**."
