My name is John. I am a **digital creator**, a self-employed **software engineer**, a **cinematographer**, and most importantly, a full-time **high school student**. My primary areas of interest are **iOS/macOS** (Swift), **Android** (Java, Kotlin), and **Web** (React/React Native, Node.js, NextJS, Flask, Django, Electron, Docker, Ubuntu Server, etc.)

"One positive effect of the non-conventional nature of me is the spark I have had ever since I was a young boy. It is like an uncontrollable wildfire where I absolutely have to sit down and sketch something whenever I have this unbelievable amount of energy — a burst of neurotransmitters — that flows through the neural pathways in my brain, fueling my overwhelming passion for **astrophysics**, **philosophy**, **computer science**, and **cinematography**."
