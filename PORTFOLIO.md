### Digital Creator
One positive effect of the non-conventional nature of me is the spark I have had ever since I was a young boy. It is like an uncontrollable wildfire where I absolutely have to sit down and sketch something whenever I have this unbelievable amount of energy — a burst of neurotransmitters — that flows through the neural pathways in my brain, fueling my overwhelming passion for astrophysics, philosophy, computer science, and cinematography.

### Software Developer
I released my first Android app on Google Play Store when I was **thirteen**. I was a self-taught Android developer who mostly created web-based apps through Android Studio. The first app I made was a benchmark app that assesses the performance of the Wi-Fi router that the device is connected with, based upon its upload & download speed as well as the link speed. (While the link speed is completely an irrelevant factor, I somehow thought it was important so I included it) As I was passionate about graphic design from a very young age as well, I tried my best to make it the most visually appealing benchmark app in the market in comparison to the major competitors such as GeekBench.

### Math & Physics Enthusiast
The idea of learning Calculus and Linear Algebra often tends to intimidate many high school students, especially those in their senior year, before taking it in school as a course. I, too, was in the same boat, in the sense that the first time I opened the AP Cal BC textbook, I could only see scribbles and white background, which did not make sense whatsoever. In addition, my mathematical knowledge was rudimentary in the sense that I have not done much mathematics outside of school as an extracurricular, mostly finding it as a subject that I could pass without having many difficulties. It was the September of 2021, however, when I first got into the art of differentiation and integration. My overwhelming passion for Calculus and Linear Algebra started when I first saw the integral sign on a blog article that introduced the basics of Quantum Mechanics, which was one of the other areas I was interested in. The peculiarly shaped brackets that surrounded the number or a sign, the bra-ket notation, combined with matrices and vectors that each represented a quantum state and a gate, fueled my emerging curiosity that later developed into a much more mature form: which is where I am standing right now as a potential math major student. It was the moment I realized that most of my worldview and reality are primarily based upon my internal beliefs, that all of my passions are my creations, and my existence itself is a construct.

## [ElectronVisualized](https://github.com/wonmor/ElectronVisualized)

A **real-time** electron density simulation **single-handedly** developed by a **high school student**. Displayed based upon the internal calculations performed that involve the state-of-the-art **Projector Augmented-wave** (PAW) method and **Density Functional Theory** (DFT): describing the **probable locations of electrons** by simplifying the N-body Schrödinger's Equation into a relatively easier-to-compute N single-body problem.

A puzzle game that visualizes the nature of a curve and its corresponding derivative function, and how various rules (e.g. power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, squeeze theorem, and L'Hôpital's rule) of differentiation can work in a given equation. It further clarifies the relationship between the rules; for example, proving the mechanism behind power rule using the first principles ```lim h->0 (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h```, or explaining the product rule using the power rule. Same goes for the editions that will be released later, which include topics such as definite/indefinite integration and infinite series.

### The game will be released in a total of *four* editions:
1. **Pre-Calculus**: The Nature of Functions
2. **The Fundamentals of Calculus**: Limits and Differentiation
3. **Integral Calculus**: The Most Powerful Humanmade Tool
4. **Infinite Series**: Let's Explore Above and Beyond
